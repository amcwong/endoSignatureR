Description: A pipeline for discovering small, interpretable gene signatures 
    from bulk RNA-seq with binary phenotypes in small cohorts. Enforces best 
    practices including nested cross-validation, in-fold preprocessing, stability 
    selection, and calibration. Demonstrated on GSE201926 endometrial lesion data.
