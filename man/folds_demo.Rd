\title{Demo CV Splits Dataset}
\format{
A list with elements:
\describe{
\item{outer_splits}{An \code{rsample} \code{vfold_cv} object containing outer CV splits.
For \code{gse201926_trainmini}, this typically contains 3 outer folds with stratified
sampling to maintain class balance.}
\item{inner_splits}{A list of \code{rsample} \code{vfold_cv} objects, one for each outer fold.
Each inner split contains CV folds for hyperparameter tuning within the outer
training set (anti-leakage). Typically 2 inner folds per outer fold.}
\item{outer_seed}{Integer; fixed random seed used for creating outer splits.
Defaults to 12345.}
\item{inner_seed}{Integer; fixed random seed used for creating inner splits.
Defaults to 67890.}
\item{n_outer_folds}{Integer; number of outer CV folds (typically 3).}
\item{n_inner_folds}{Integer; number of inner CV folds per outer fold (typically 2).}
\item{split_type}{Character; type of split used ("vfold_cv" for K-fold cross-validation).}
\item{strata}{Character; column name used for stratified sampling ("group" for PS/PIS balance).}
\item{created_date}{Date; date when folds were created.}
}

\source{
Created from \code{gse201926_trainmini} using \code{rsample::vfold_cv()} with fixed seeds.

\usage{

}
\description{
Pre-computed cross-validation splits with fixed seeds for reproducible examples
in vignettes and tests. Used to avoid recomputing splits during demonstrations.
}
\details{
This dataset stores pre-computed CV splits for \code{gse201926_trainmini} to enable:

\strong{Reproducibility}: Fixed seeds ensure identical splits across runs
\strong{Speed}: Pre-computed splits avoid recomputation in vignettes/tests
\strong{Determinism}: Same seed always produces same splits
\strong{Anti-leakage}: Inner splits are created only on training data (nested CV)

\strong{Usage:}
\itemize{
\item Load folds: \code{data(folds_demo)}
\item Access outer splits: \code{folds_demo$outer_splits}
\item Access inner splits: \code{folds_demo$inner_splits[[1]]} (for first outer fold)
\item Get training/test data: \code{rsample::training(folds_demo$outer_splits$splits[[1]])}
}

\strong{Split Structure:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Outer splits}: Used for model selection/validation
\itemize{
\item 3-fold stratified CV for \code{gse201926_trainmini} (12 samples)
\item Each fold maintains class balance (PS/PIS)
}
\item \strong{Inner splits}: Used for hyperparameter tuning within each outer fold
\itemize{
\item 2-fold CV for each outer training set (8 samples after leaving 4 out)
\item Ensures test data never influences tuning decisions (anti-leakage)
}
}

\strong{Builder Script:} \code{data-raw/build_folds_demo.R} creates splits using \code{rsample::vfold_cv()}
with fixed seeds and saves to \code{data/folds_demo.rda}. Script must be run after
\code{gse201926_trainmini} is created.
